Hi there and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Noah Manz, and I am a first year medical student at the University of Vermont. I have a B.S. and M.S. in Materials and Metallurgical Engineering from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. I have a very strong applied math background, and have started a data science/data analytics side hustle to help small businesses use their data to make smarter business decisions.
