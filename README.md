<ins>About Me:</ins>
 
Hi there and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Noah Manz, and I am a first year medical student at the University of Vermont. I have a B.S. and M.S. in Materials and Metallurgical Engineering from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. I have a very strong applied math background, and have started a data science/data analytics side hustle to help small businesses use their data to make smarter business decisions. Click on any of the above files to view some of my written, Photoshop and programming work!

"Noah helped me take a 70,000 row Excel spreadsheet and remove duplicate mailing addresses so that campaign mail would only be sent to a household once. He saved me tons of time because otherwise I would have had to delete these entires manually!"
